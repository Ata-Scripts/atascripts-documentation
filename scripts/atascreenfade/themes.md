### Customizing the Loading Screen for Dynamic Screen Fade Control

Configure the appearance of your loading screen with precision using our script's flexible settings. You can customize everything from the logo to the background and loading spinner.

#### Logo Settings

* **Logo**: Place your custom logo within the `html/img` directory for easy access. Recommended format is SVG,PNG for optimal clarity. Example: `img/ata2.svg`. or URL
* **Shadow**: Add a subtle shadow to the logo for enhanced visual depth. This feature can be disabled by setting `shadow` to `false`.
* **Animation Logo**: Assign a predefined animation to your logo to make it dynamic and engaging. Select from the list of available animations below.  [#list-of-animation-classes](themes.md#list-of-animation-classes "mention")
